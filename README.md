# A/B Testing
</div>
<hr>

A/B testing, also known as split testing, is a statistical method used to compare two different versions of a website, mobile app, email campaign, or other marketing asset to determine which one performs better in terms of user engagement, conversions, or other metrics.

In A/B testing, two versions of the same asset (A and B) are created, each with a single difference between them (such as a different headline, button color, or layout). A sample of users or visitors is randomly assigned to either version A or B, and their behavior is tracked and analyzed. The goal is to determine which version performs better and to use that version going forward.

A/B testing is commonly used in marketing, product development, and UX design departments of companies to optimize their digital assets and increase conversions, revenue, and customer satisfaction.

### Some of well-known real life examples;

- **E-commerce:** An e-commerce company might use A/B testing to optimize their checkout process. They could test different versions of their checkout page, such as different button colors, wording, and placement of elements to see which version results in more completed purchases.

- **Publishing:** A publishing company might use A/B testing to optimize the headlines of their articles. They could test different versions of the headline to see which version results in more clicks and engagement from readers.

- **Travel:** A travel company might use A/B testing to optimize their pricing strategy. They could test different prices for the same package or tour to see which version results in more bookings and revenue.

- **Healthcare:** A healthcare company might use A/B testing to optimize their patient engagement strategy. They could test different communication methods, such as email, phone calls, or SMS, to see which version results in more patients scheduling appointments or following through with treatments.

- **Software:** A software company might use A/B testing to optimize their user interface. They could test different designs, colors, and placement of elements to see which version results in more user engagement and satisfaction.
